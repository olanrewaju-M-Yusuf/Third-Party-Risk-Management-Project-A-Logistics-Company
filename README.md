# Third-Party-Risk-Management -A-Logistics-Company

## Project Title
**Developing a Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM) Framework for a Global Logistics Provider**

---

## 1. Background & Problem Statement
A global logistics company managing sensitive customer delivery data, fleet tracking systems, and supplier networks had no formal third-party risk management process in place. Following a minor security incident involving a GPS hardware vendor, executive leadership requested a comprehensive TPRM framework to mitigate third-party cyber, operational, and compliance risks. The GRC Analyst was assigned to lead the implementation of a TPRM lifecycle aligned with industry standards.

---

## 2. Objective
- Establish a scalable TPRM framework from scratch
- Build a centralized third-party inventory and classification system
- Perform vendor risk assessments using tiered methodologies
- Automate risk workflows and integrate with procurement
- Align with NIST, ISO, and industry-specific standards (e.g., TAPA)

## 4. Frameworks Used
- **NIST SP 800-161 Rev. 1**: Supply chain risk management framework [(NIST, 2023)](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-161/rev-1/final)
- **ISO/IEC 27036-3**: Information security for supplier relationships [(ISO, 2013)](https://www.iso.org/standard/59648.html)
- **Shared Assessments SIG**: Due diligence questionnaire and standard control catalog [(Shared Assessments, 2023)](https://sharedassessments.org/)

## 5. Project Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Vendor Inventory & Classification
Collaborated with procurement to identify all third parties across departments. Vendors were classified based on service type, data access level, and criticality to logistics operations. Categories included GPS services, warehousing partners, IT software, and last-mile delivery subcontractors.

### Step 2: Risk Assessment & Due Diligence
Developed tiered vendor questionnaires using the Shared Assessments SIG, customized with NIST 800-161 supply chain controls. High-risk vendors underwent extended assessments including on-site audits and cyber posture evaluations.

### Step 3: Policy & Process Development
Created the Third-Party Risk Management Policy, Onboarding Checklist, and Incident Reporting Playbook. All documents were mapped to ISO 27036-3 requirements. Roles and responsibilities were codified in the governance charter.

### Step 4: Tool Integration & Automation
Integrated vendor risk management into the ServiceNow GRC module. Automated workflows enabled risk scoring, contract reviews, periodic reassessments, and alerting. A quarterly compliance review process was formalized.

### Step 5: Monitoring & Continuous Improvement
Built a vendor monitoring dashboard in Power BI, tracking assessment scores, SLA performance, and control failures. Lessons learned from vendor incidents were fed back into the risk scoring model for recalibration.

## 6. Key Takeaways
- Early procurement integration ensures consistent risk onboarding
- Tiered risk assessments optimize resource allocation
- Automation enables scalable, real-time TPRM operations
- Aligning policies with ISO/NIST increases credibility with partners
- Risk score dashboards help prioritize and communicate effectively
- Internal awareness and training improved vendor engagement

---

## 7. Outcomes
- Assessed and classified over 230 third-party vendors
- 100% of critical vendors now reassessed annually
- Reduced vendor-related incident response time by 60%
- Implemented TPRM policy adopted across all regional offices
- Increased third-party SLA compliance from 74% → 96% over 12 months
